consider that i have two files ui_details.csv and app_details.csv as well two folders filtered_traces and semantic_annotations
the columns in ui_details.csv are UI Number, App Package Name, Interaction Trace Number, UI Number in Trace
the columns in app_details.csv are App Package Name, Play Store Name, Category, Average Rating, Number of Ratings, Number of Downloads, Date Updated, Icon URL
semantic_annotations consists of json files describing view hierarchies of ui and are named as UI Number.json
filtered_traces consists of folders named by App Package Name. Each folder has folders for different Interaction Trace Numbers. Each of these folders has folders has view_hierarchies folder and gestures.json file. the view_hierarchies folder has json files describing the view hierarchies of ui and are named as UI Number in Trace.json
i need a python program that creates a csv file by collecting specific details from <UI Number in Trace>.json files and respective <UI Number>.json files based on the given csv files. I will specify an App PAckage Name and an Interaction Trace Number. based on that a csv file should be generated for a unique combination of these 2. The csv file should extract
