2. Authors are suggested to cite relevant references for the discussion given in the intial
sections.

3. Objectives should be limited. Whether the authors accomplished all the objectives in
the research work if so it should validated through detailed discussion otherwise
objectives should be revised.
done
4. Proposed model discussion should be improved. how semantic matching has been
performed? What are all the techniques incorporated for semantic matching and how
the algorithms are selected? all the above queries should be addressed in the
discussion.
